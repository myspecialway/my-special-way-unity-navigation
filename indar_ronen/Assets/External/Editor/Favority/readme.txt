    How To Use
-----------------
- Open the Favority window through the 'Window > Favority' menu.
- By default the window opens on the Project tab: drag'n'drop assets from the Project View to the Favority window to add them to your favorite list.
- Now click any of the items in the list to select them again, or double-click them to open them.
- Switch to the Scene tab: you can now drag'n'drop scene objects from the Hierarchy View to the Favority window.
  The list is saved per-scene: try switching to a different scene, add some objects, then come back to your first scene.
  Note: the objects need to be saved in the scene at least once for Unity to give them a persistent ID that Favority can remember.
- You can also drag assets to the Scene tab (eg if you have prefabs that are only relevant to a particular scene).
- You can reorder items simply by dragging them in the list.
- You can open another Favority window by clicking the '+' button in the top right corner.
  You can dock one window near the Hierarchy View, and one near the Project View.
